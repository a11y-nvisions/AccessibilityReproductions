  "h3_try_experience":"Try experience this yourself",
  "try_experience_paragraph1":"Try pass below using an swipe navigation gesture of VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad. You won't be able to pass there.",
  "try_experience_paragraph2":"And then navigate a next clock section. maybe you're possible to passing there with VoiceOver.",
  "h3_conclusion":"Conclusion",
  "conclusion_paragraph1" : "It's surprising. What are you think why can VoiceOver navigate and pass this? A hint is between a fisrt clock and the last clock, there's one difference. That difference is how to update data.",
  "conclusion_paragraph2" : "The last clock only updates text nodes that are inside of the element. It means this clock doesn't replace a whole element with a new element for updating new data. iOS VoiceOver cannot explore elements that have been quickly and repeatedly added and removed., and, VoiceOver will recognize a last-navigated element as the last element of the current screen like a fool :)",
  "conclusion_paragraph3" : "Do not replace whole elements for updating data. When updating data, please update a text inside the element only for making a stable user experience for your websites and web applications."
